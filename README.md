Many developers (like me) has problems with organograms charts in mobile screens, 
this a prototype for a vertical organogram chart made with Bootstrap and CSS. There is only two hierarchical levels (from unlimited), 
decrease your browser width and you'll see how the largest names are well fitted exactly in the middle of the boxes. 
This is a perfect fully responsive prototype, just need to be improved as you need.

There are two examples available.
